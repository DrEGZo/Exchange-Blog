  // has returned yet), so that we know whether or not it's safe to emit

  // a read from the buffer.

  // deeply ugly to write APIs this way, but that still doesn't mean
  // that the Readable class should behave improperly, as streams are
  // designed to be sync/async agnostic.
  // Take note if the _read call is sync or async (ie, if the read call
  // has returned yet), so that we know whether or not it's safe to emit
  // 'readable' etc.
  //
  // 3. Actually pull the requested chunks out of the buffer and return.
