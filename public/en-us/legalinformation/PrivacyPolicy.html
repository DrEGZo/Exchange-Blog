        <p>The "administrator" is the responsible contact person mentioned in the site note.</p>
        <h5>Google Cloud Firestore</h5>
        <p>When registering on the website, all users have to provide some personal data and get the chance to subscribe to email notifications / newsletters. Whith exception of email and password, all of these data are stored in the Google Cloud Firestore and are maintained by the administrator.​</p>
        <p>The real name is used to identify a user by the administrator and as a salutation in newsletters. It will not be visible to any other users.</p>
        <p>The username (nickname) is used for writing comments on the website. Therefore a users's username will be displayed next to comments written by this user.</p>
        <p>With exception of the real name, all of these data can be altered afterwards in the profile settings. This implies the possibility to opt out from the newsletters.</p>
